# Toetactics

This is a little library that can act as a programmatic client for playing TicTacToe on http://games.riesd.com/

To start a game clone this repository locally, bundle install and then run a command like:

```
ruby -Ilib exe/toetactics play game5
```

You will see a lot of output about the messages received and sent by this client so you can decide how to customize it.
